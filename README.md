# üåç NASA HLS Map Viewer

![NASA HLS Map Viewer](./nasaImg.png)

A React + OpenLayers + Redux web application for exploring NASA Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) WMTS imagery from the Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS).  
Supports date selection, event navigation from a JSON dataset, style switching (True Color, False Color, Night Band), and layer toggling.  
Uses Redux for persisting map settings (style/date) with a 6-day expiration for faster reloads.
